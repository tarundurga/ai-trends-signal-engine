# LinkedIn Drafts — Week of 2026-02-13

## Draft 1 — CXO lens (decision-grade)
**Hook:** Most AI strategies are still tool strategies. That’s the wrong unit of change.

What’s emerging more clearly is this: AI adoption is becoming a *work design* problem.

Two patterns are diverging:
Large organisations (47 signals) are converging on stability and risk management — building enablement programs, governance layers, and controlled rollouts.

Mid-sized organisations (131 signals) are prioritising speed and leverage, expecting individuals to integrate AI directly into their work with minimal formal structure.

And a repeatable whitespace shows up across both:
Several gaps are becoming visible between intent and execution:

- **Manager enablement**: Middle management is expected to lead AI adoption, but few organisations are explicitly building AI judgement and facilitation skills at this layer.

- **Role transition frameworks**: Organisations talk about reskilling, but lack clear models for how existing roles evolve when AI becomes a collaborator.

- **Decision quality metrics**: Tools are measured, but there is limited focus on how AI changes the quality, speed, and confidence of decisions.

These represent opportunities to act early — before they become formalised best practices.

If you’re planning next quarter, the safest first move is to redesign a few roles and manager rituals — then scale tools behind that.

- Pilot manager-focused AI enablement, not just individual training
- Redesign 2–3 critical roles assuming AI support
- Create explicit forums to clarify decision ownership in AI-assisted work
- Treat whitespace initiatives as strategic experiments, not compliance exercises

**Close:** If you had to pick one place to start: manager enablement or role redesign — which would you choose, and why?

## Draft 2 — Designer / creator lens (work & craft)
**Hook:** AI won’t replace creative work. It will replace *unclear craft*.

The most interesting shift isn’t new tools — it’s how the definition of ‘good work’ is changing.

When AI becomes a collaborator, craft moves upstream:
- clearer intent
- better judgement
- stronger taste
- tighter feedback loops

That means designers, writers, strategists, and creators need to focus less on output volume and more on:
- framing problems well
- asking better questions
- reviewing and refining with discipline
- knowing what should *not* be delegated

In India, this matters because teams are large, time is scarce, and ambiguity is everywhere. The creator advantage will go to people who can consistently produce clarity.

**Close:** What part of your craft have you already started protecting from AI — and what part have you happily delegated?

## Draft 3 — Contrarian lens (safe, grounded)
**Hook:** A quiet risk: ‘AI fluency’ programmes that don’t change how decisions are made.

A lot of organisations are optimising for training completion and tool usage.

But the real question is: are decisions getting better?

**What people are saying:** ‘We need more AI tools / pilots to move faster.’
**What’s actually happening (signals):** Signals point more strongly to enablement + role change + governance than tool novelty (this week: largecap=47, midcap=131; trend_snapshot=2026-W06). Hiring signals increasingly expect AI-in-role rather than ‘AI team’ add-ons.
**Why this matters (India):** In India, tool adoption outpaces role clarity. Without explicit accountability, you risk inconsistent outputs and manager confusion—especially in large, distributed teams.
**Safer move for leaders:** Start with role redesign + manager guidance for 2–3 workflows, then scale tools and standards behind that.

In practice, this means pairing AI fluency with simple decision-quality rituals:
- define when AI output needs review
- track errors avoided and time saved
- make accountability explicit

Otherwise AI becomes noise — amplified at speed.

**Close:** If you run enablement: do you measure adoption, or decision quality — and why?
