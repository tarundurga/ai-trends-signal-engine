# Contrarian AI Work & Skills Notes — Week of 2026-01-02

## 1) The “false obvious” narrative
**What people are saying:** ‘We need more AI tools / pilots to move faster.’
**What’s actually happening (signals):** Signals point more strongly to enablement + role change + governance than tool novelty (this week: largecap=48, midcap=103; trend_snapshot=2026-W00). Hiring signals increasingly expect AI-in-role rather than ‘AI team’ add-ons.
**Why this matters (India):** In India, tool adoption outpaces role clarity. Without explicit accountability, you risk inconsistent outputs and manager confusion—especially in large, distributed teams.
**Safer move for leaders:** Start with role redesign + manager guidance for 2–3 workflows, then scale tools and standards behind that.

## 2) The “over-rotation” risk
**What people are optimising for:** ‘If we train everyone on prompts, we’ve done AI enablement.’
**What gets neglected:** Skill language is shifting from ‘prompting’ to judgement, evaluation, guardrails, and outcome ownership. Training-only approaches show up without corresponding decision-quality measures (this week: largecap=48, midcap=103; trend_snapshot=2026-W00).
**Why this matters (India):** Training becomes a tick-box if managers don’t change how work is reviewed. India’s constraint is not access to AI, it’s aligning judgement across levels and functions.
**Safer move for leaders:** Pair fluency with ‘decision quality’ rituals: review samples, define when to trust AI, and track errors avoided/time saved.

## 3) The “missing owner” problem
**What is falling through the cracks:** AI adoption is treated as either IT’s job or an individual productivity hack.
**Where it shows up (signals):** The most dangerous gap is manager enablement + decision ownership (this week: largecap=48, midcap=103; trend_snapshot=2026-W00). Midcaps move fast; largecaps add governance—both can miss the manager layer.
**Why this matters (India):** Manager bandwidth and ambiguity tolerance vary widely. If you don’t equip managers, adoption becomes uneven and political.
**Safer move for leaders:** Create a lightweight ‘manager playbook’: decision rights, review norms, escalation paths, and examples of good AI-assisted work.
